  AoqiaToothbrushMod
</h1>

This is a toothbrush mod and it's completely open-source.<br>
The idea was from "Madman's Toothpase Emporium" which hasn't been updated in quite some time.

## Details

-   Needs at least a toothbrush to work! Toothpaste is optional and will double the speed of brushing.
-   Brush your teeth to reduce unhappyness (`-10` only twice a day)! Toothpaste speeds up this process by `2x`.
-   If you don't brush your teeth at least once a day, you will accumulate an unhappyness buff every day.
