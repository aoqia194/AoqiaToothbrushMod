  AoqiaToothbrushMod
</h1>

This is a toothbrush mod and it's completely open-source.<br>
The idea was from "Madman's Toothpase Emporium" which hasn't been updated in quite some time.

## Details

- Brush your teeth to reduce unhappyness! Toothpaste speeds up this process by 2x.
- If you don't brush your teeth at least once a day, you will accumulate an unhappyness buff every day.

## TODO

-   [ ] Bad teeth trait?
-   [ ] Fuagh moodle after a week of no brushing
-   [x] Unable to brush teeth when depressed?
-   [ ] Make toothpaste item a Drainable (big task I think)
-   [ ] Unhappyness due to not cleaning teeth also applies if you only brush teeth once (although it is less significant)
